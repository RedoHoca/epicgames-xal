## Introduction

The `xal` value is a critical component in how Epic Games generates data for hCaptcha. This repository aims to demystify the process by offering tools and insights that can be used for further research and development. 

## Features

- **Reverse Engineering**: Understand how the `xal` value is generated.
- **Data Analysis**: Analyze client-side behavior tracking.
- **Python Toolkit**: Utilize a robust Python-based toolkit for easy integration.
- **HTTP Toolkit**: Use built-in tools to monitor and analyze HTTP requests.

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RedoHoca/epicgames-xal.git
cd epicgames-xal
```

Next, install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To use the tools provided in this repository, first ensure you have downloaded the necessary files from the [Releases section](https://github.com/RedoHoca/epicgames-xal/releases). Execute the downloaded files according to the provided instructions.

### Basic Commands

Here are some basic commands to get you started:

```bash
python main.py --option value
```

Replace `--option` and `value` with the actual options you wish to use. For detailed command options, refer to the documentation in the `docs` folder.

## Understanding XAL

The `xal` value is not just a random string; it plays a significant role in how hCaptcha and Epic Games track user behavior. Understanding this value can help in various fields, including security research and data analysis.

### What is hCaptcha?

hCaptcha is a service that helps websites protect themselves from bots. It does this by requiring users to complete challenges that are easy for humans but difficult for automated systems. The `xal` value is part of this process.

### How Does `xal` Work?

The `xal` value is generated based on specific algorithms that consider user behavior and other parameters. By reverse engineering this value, we can gain insights into how these algorithms function and potentially improve our own applications.
